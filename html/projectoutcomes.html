                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Our fitness app is equipped with many functions that are crucial for each user to maintain good health and achieve their workout goal. First of all, the app can connect with smart watches to calculate calories, identify health problems, and give advice about the user’ health condition and how to improve it. Secondly, it can automatically modify the level of exercise and suggest diet plans that are suitable for each user based on their physical condition like weight, height, age, their collected data during the workout or their goals. Moreover, the app provides details of calories in each food and calculates the total amount of calories consumption that is suitable for each user. Furthermore, the app has the ability to track users’ movements while they are doing the exercises to prevent any injuries due to incorrect posture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many functions like making a diet plan and workout sessions, or checking the users’ health are operated by collecting and analyzing the data from the user’s training, then the results are used to improve the efficiency and precision of the app functions and services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app is designed to support people who are busy or lack knowledge about nutrition and fitness. Our fitness app can support them by arranging the timetable, diet plans, and workouts for them. Also, our app would push notifications about pro tips and set alarm for exercises if users have not moved for around 30 minutes; our app would come up with different tasks in order to avoid repetition, which could cause boredom and frustration. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have not finished developing the whole project yet; just a few details about UI, purposes, … We will try to complete it within 2 years (the reason why we need a long period of time is when this app is completed, whether it is trial or official version, we want it to be fully equipped with what we had announced about our app).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we have been working on this project, we realized that there are many challenging issues. One of the first problems is our limited knowledge about health and fitness. The field of health is wide so researching might take a long time and it is difficult to ensure perfect precision. Secondly, we are lacking skill and knowledge about app development so completing the app is time-consuming and it can have many minor bugs or errors. Furthermore, limitation in skill can lead to low-quality products. For example, the final product might have features that do not work like our intention. Importantly, security is our most concern since it is a standard key point for an app to operate properly and it relates to our reputation with the customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the first year, we would launch a closed beta version and invite some individuals to download; these selected people would play a significant role in evaluating, developing and completing our trial version. If the previous stage was fully achieved, we would release an open beta version for everyone to download via App Store or Google Play Store; we would try to fix most of the bugs that appeared in this period by releasing updates once per 2 months.
