                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <h3>Topic</h3>
                <p>In this project, we intend to create a fitness app equipped with A.I technology that can be the users’ private professional trainer. 
                    The app can support users in creating their own workout plan based on the statistics of users and their timetable, sharing useful medical knowledge, and diagnosing users’ disease based on their recorded data during their workout. 
                    By using A.I this will allow users to experience more efficient workout exercises and shorten the time to achieve their goals. 
                    Most importantly, this app can promote a healthier lifestyle for the users because their professional trainer can follow them anywhere, at any time and it allows people to arrange their timetable easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, by developing this fitness app, we aim to raise funds for charity through the number of users who download our app; 
                    we will try to connect with charitable foundations in order to support the poor from all around Vietnam (we would mainly focus on those who live in remote areas).  
                    For example, if possible, we will host a triathlon to raise funds for free surgeries, free vaccinations for poor children and adults. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we will try to launch campaigns (it would be usually related to charitable activities but sometimes there would be prizes for users who reach their goals). 
                    There would be many online and offline challenges yearly (these challenges are also taking part in diagnosing and assessing the current status of users’ health) such as yoga competitions, holding breath challenge, balancing test, … 
                    We want to fully understand every users’ status so that our app would perform the best as it has in guiding and protecting our users. 
                </p>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    Our motivation for this project is promoting people to have a healthy lifestyle including both physically and mentally. This project is interesting because our app is user-friendly, relaxing, informative, … We try to focus on bringing the best experience for users when they decide to download our app by following in the pioneers’ footsteps but we will modify the whole structure with our own plan; we would refer to the previous apps/websites UI (User Interface), UX (User Experience), … with a view to harmoniously combining base systems with our up-to-date information and eye-catching design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While doing research, we find that our app would be completely fitted in current IT trends in Vietnam since for the last 5 years, the Mobile applications development field has been chosen a lot when students graduated from universities/colleges. That’s why we believe that when our app is launched, we hope it will gain success (maybe not too much at the first phase but gradually it will have real impacts on the market and would be a real contender for related apps/websites). 
                </p>
                <h3>Landscape</h3>
                <p>
                    As a part of the market, we know that many applications were created before our apps such as Apple Fitness+ or Nike Run Club. Those applications provide many exercises and it is very comfortable for users to keep fit everywhere. Our application has many special features to make it different from other apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first aspect is that our app can connect with smartwatches such as the Apple Watch or Galaxy Watch to collect data while the user is doing exercise and calculating calories customers have burned, as well as analyzing the collected data to identify any health issues and give advice to improve the users’ health. (in the foreseeable future there will be more compatible smartwatches and we will try to update biannually).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second aspect is reminder, our system can notify users to take an exercise everyday and keep on a healthy track. We also provide many diet plans for users to choose. In the diet plan, we suggest healthy and diet foods, then we make exercises suitable for diet people to push their progress faster. Most importantly, our app consists of everything when it comes to healthcare’s field (Fitness, Nutrition and Medical are three most crucial sections in this area) and our app looks like an encyclopedia for healthcare’s ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next aspect is we provide a bunch of exercise types such as pilates, high intensity interval training, … while the present apps on the market just help us perform running exercises. It can improve users' interest while using our apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, our app can track the movement of the user, so that when the users fall, the app depends on the phone's gyroscope to decide to call an ambulance if users are in danger.
                </p>
                <h2>Detailed description</h2>
                <h3>Aims</h3>
                <p>
                    When we decided to pick this idea as the content for our project, our top priority aim is promoting a healthier lifestyle for anyone who is keen on keeping their body fitted. As we have mentioned, our app is equipped with an A.I that can easily recognize and follow users’ movements while they are practicing with our lessons. This feature is specifically designed for instructing users how to perform nearly as professional trainers do. Although users’ motions will not be exactly the same as trainers’ but by pointing out mistakes and showing correct forms, users will be encouraged and would likely finish their courses in no time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to achieve our aim, there are some smaller goals that need to be achieved (but there are 2 main goals that we would pay more attention to); the first goal is collaborating with as many Gym & Fitness clubs as possible. We want to bring a variety of exercises, approaches by different techniques from diverse styles (such as Yoga, Boxing, Pilates, Weightlifting, Cycling, Mountain climbing, …). By this way, customers would be excited about our app and this could increase the number of healthy people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second goal that is also vital to our aim is the UI/UX of our app. This app is being created with a view to mostly concentrate on Millennials and generation Z (people who were born from 1981 to 1996 and from 1997 to 2012). These two generations are excellent at using smart devices and catch up with trends. In this field, we will offer users to customize their own theme, background on their devices (it would be acceptable to set our app as an open source version but only for customizing background and color themes). This feature could help any users to show off their styles or their own characteristics and it might help our customers find our app more attractive which could lead to better performances, better results and better them.
                </p>
                <h3>Plans and Progress</h3>
                <p>
                    At the start of our Intro to IT course, we were assigned to a group. At first, our team had only 3 members; we first contacted each other via Teams chat when we had our first online lesson, then we had a Discord channel for anyone who would study a tutorial class the next day. We all chose to study at 8:30 A.M so we joined the group for anyone who chose that time. After that, there was a guy who asked whether everyone wanted to meet up at the canteen 30 minutes before class began; everyone agreed and texted each other in order not to forget the meet-up the next day. We first met at the canteen before our first tutorial class; later, in week 3 of the course, while our team had completed about 40% of the group work, our team had 1 more member named Duy who had been randomly added into our group and we started to have some talks in order to get to know each other. After that, in week 4, our first choice of doing this project was a note-taking application along with a pure fitness app. Then we got down to work by writing a project proposal. We followed our lecturer’s instructions which had been uploaded to Canvas. Firstly, we created a Google Docs so that all 4 members of the team could easily edit and contribute to the group work. Secondly, we instantly filled in information that we had already had such as basic profiles, descriptions, table of contents, … so that we would have more time to brainstorm for more sophisticated details. Thirdly, we handed in our early version of our project and we immediately received feedback from our lecturer; he said that we should only have focused on 1 programme and reformatted our document since it was blankly ordered. Fourthly, we added extra information about our scope, timetable, risks and solutions; about our scope and timetable, we used tables to illustrate our reasons and timelines, which allowed our details to be clearer and more informative. For the risks and solutions part, bullet points were used in order to list all of the particular drawbacks, along with appropriate solutions. Finally, after 2 weeks of intensively researching and surveying, we finally finished our proposal tasks 2 days earlier than submission (November 11th 2022).
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 2 weeks of anxiously waiting (on November 27th), we finally received our score for the project proposal. We were completely surprised at the mark we received from our instructor; we received an 8 out of 10, which was an HD for that assignment. We did not expect to receive such a good score since we thought our proposals were not well-informed enough and we could have done much better but we took it as a huge motivation in order to keep moving forward. After having our score, we decided to take a short break, we went on studying other courses (all members of our team study the same courses with each other) and dealt with deadlines of Intro to Computer System course and also practiced coding for Intro to Programming course. During this time, we were completely stressed out because of piles of assignments and exams but we motivated ourselves to solve issues step-by-step and helped each other whenever someone in our group encountered interruptions. We got back to work instantly after we completed our in-class tests of all 3 courses. We gathered up at a large sitting area in the Student Connect corner and discussed further steps with a view to preparing for the next two assignments which were related to our proposal task: Presentation and Final report of our fitness app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On December 7th, we restarted our group project; instead of writing proposals like we had done previously, we actually created a demo version of our fitness app and wrote a report as precise as possible for our two final assignments of the course. We started to do the final report first because it was too much information to do in only a few days before deadline; we copied all of the criterias which had been uploaded on Canvas into our Google Docs so that we could follow the structure more easily and anyone could type in details straight away without looking at Canvas. This approach could save us a significant amount of time in order to conduct the report more carefully.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the Final report, despite having a proposal task, we transformed ideas from bullet points style into paragraphs and sentences. We thought that writing ideas in paragraphs would be more understandable since we had supporting evidence for our major conclusions; also it would be more professional when it came to formal writing or when submitted to professors/companies. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    About the Presentation slides, we chose Canva to be the platform that we created our slides because of its diversity in templates and its splendor. However, that was the first time we actually used Canva to present so we did not get used to it; we found it a bit complicated and confusing because Canva’s features are unfamiliar to us, we always use PowerPoint or Google Slides so it took us a while to do the slides. We attempted to use simple theme (only some neutral colors with a few of objects in order to highlight some crucial slides) and we wanted our slides to contain as few words as possible plus using videos or images to raise the presentation’s attractiveness (because if there had been the abundance of words, audiences would have got bored of paying attention to our presentation).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final two assignments also asked us to show to the whole class our project demo (which was an app but we chose to create a website containing all of the aspects that we ensured to bring them into our mobile app). We were a bit careless about the large amount of work; we thought that after having done our proposal task so we did our report leisurely and we had to pay for it. We were in a rush for the whole previous week when deadlines from all courses appeared to us repeatedly; we had to stay up late, till 2-3 A.M in order to edit and fill in a vast majority of information. Additionally, we only did our presentation’s slides 4 days before presenting to the whole class so once again, we were in a hurry completing the slides as clearly as possible and we tried not to exceed the limits that had been declared previously. We chose about 4 different themes and none of them met our requirements (some were too dark, some were illogically organized). After multiple times switching between potential templates, we chose a simple theme with white and green color added with mild objects. The process of adding information into the slides took us approximately 3 and a half days but thankfully, we finally finished all of our assignments in time and when we looked back, we thought that all members of our group had done a great job despite being exhausted from multiple deadlines incoming. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the one hand, if I were to hand over our team’s project to another team, I would tell that take good care of our project; I would ask them to add more unique features that no apps or websites have ever been displayed (community-customized app icons, precise weather forecast for anyone who intends to participate in outdoor sports, …). Moreover, I would request them to use their best efforts to actually develop this app so that our dream would come true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, if  I were the one to take over this project from someone, I would directly ask them about the options they want to develop their app/website and all of their requirements, needs and changes to optimize their product. Furthermore, I want to know further about their codes, platforms they use to invent their app/website so that our team can improvise by dealing with problems on other sources when original systems crash (for example, if there are something wrong with PyCharm, we will initiate to debug on VS Code or Vim).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, we are very honored to have got involved such an interesting project like this: we have a chance to know further about how an app (or a website) is actually developed, we also gain more experience in researching and communicating when it comes to teamwork and most importantly, we adapt to dealing with deadlines without any concerns or hesitations. 
                </p>
                <h3>Roles</h3>
                <p>
                    Our team has 4 members but we have decided not to select anyone to be the Project Leader because it may cause unintentional bias and gradually it would end up with miscommunication or conflicts; we only agreed on choosing Phúc as the leader of programming the first edition of our app (Phúc would be chiefly responsible for creating our app and he also plays a crucial role in fixing bugs also updating new features to enhance users’ experience). The other guys will handle paperworks, supporting Phúc in finding errors in order to solve it properly.
                </p>
                <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
                <p>
                    The first thing is that we want to build up an online workout platform in the COVID background in order to motivate people to keep fit while staying at home. We also connect people together by taking exercises in the same session.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next thing we aim for is the health safety of users. Our apps can collect data from smartwatches and phones to predict falls or danger and call an ambulance if needed. Our app can base on the health index of users to calculate the best way for them to lose weight safely and more efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We design our app very friendly with users. The menu of the app is divided into many categories for each exercise type. If the users are not sure which type of exercise they need to choose, we also provide many suggestions about exercise compatible with each type of person. Exercise calendar is one of the functions of our app, it displays what exercise customers need to take in separate days, so that the users can easily manage their time. If the users are stuck in a bug, they can directly report them to us via the bug report button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, we have some functions that can not come true due to some limits. We can not add AI into the app because it will take a lot of time to do it while the time of assignment is limited.
                </p>
                <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                <h3>Testing</h3>
                <h3>Risks</h3>
                <p>
                    Our project mainly illustrates videos, images or articles about the healthcare field so we would have to double check the authenticity of these media files (whether it is coming from multiple sources or many individuals who claim to be the author of these files. In addition, another major problem which could cause us long hours of detecting and securing our app is hackers. Because we just get involved in the app/website development field in a short period of time so we are not used to overthinking and fully preparing for cyberattacks; these hackers might steal our ideas, codes, … in order to plagiarize.
                </p>
                <h3>Group processes and communications</h3>
                <p>
                    We arrange online meetings via Teams on Fridays; in these meetings, we usually deal with our report, presentation by adding suitable information, reformatting and consulting together. We also hold offline meetings but they are not so often because we do not have enough time to meet up in the same time (we only met face-to-face twice apart from tutorial lessons, once in Monday and once in Saturday); we usually choose a coffee shop, sit in a large table and we get down to work. This is where we mostly do our prototype. Our team has a guy that is appointed to be the leader of this topic; he would be mainly in charge of coding, debugging the app and the rest would help him in designing and sorting issues that could appear.
                </p>
