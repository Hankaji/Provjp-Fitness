                            <p>Hello everyone, my full name is Dao Bao Duy and my student ID is s3978826. Now I live in Ho Chi Minh city alone in order to study at university. I want to take a course at RMIT to develop my coding skill and get a bachelor's degree in order to find a job. 
                                In the past, I studied at Huynh Man Dat high school where I gained a lot of computer skills. In university, I want to establish more relationships with other students. Furthermore, the IT course can help me develop many skills such as coding or typing skills that are relevant to my favorite field. 
                                I am also interested in video games because they can help me relax after a hard studying time. In the future, I love to be a web developer to perform what I have learned from school to make money.

                                I used to study at Trần Đại Nghĩa High school for the gifted for 7 years and then enrolled in RMIT University from semester 3 in 2022. My main pastimes are playing games (types that enhance my reflex and managerial decisions), traveling (I want to get to know more about different cultures and how they adapt to extreme circumstances). 
                                Moreover, I love being involved in developing apps/websites because I find it very interesting and practical even though I have no experience in this field compared to my teammates but I will try my best. 
                                I am taking this IT course at RMIT with a view to building up my skills and achieving my potential of performing jobs related to IT projects.

                            <p>Hi, my name is Hoang Thai Phuc, I’m currently studying at RMIT University and my sID is 3978081. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City. I recently completed my secondary education at Vstarschool, located in district 7, and am currently enrolling in the IT program at RMIT. 
                                I have a passion for developing websites and apps and my goal is to be working as a full-stack-er in a company or as a freelancer. Apart from that, I also want to achieve mandatory soft skills and life skills which will help me in my future life. 
                                My strengths include my ability to learn, be patient and take criticism. Aside from schooling, I also have an interest in playing video games and listening to Japanese music or learning about their culture. I often spend most of my spare time gaming with my friends or teaching myself more about programming. 
                                I have been gaining a lot of coding experience from self-taught for the past two years.
